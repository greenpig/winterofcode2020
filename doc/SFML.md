# SFML Developement Notes

Feng Zhou, 2020-5-5

Here we write up our experience and practices in writng SFML games. We are looking
to create 2D, RPG / plaformer kind of games. We have a set of goals.

 * Creating games as **a way to learn practical C++ programming** / creating learning materials
   for young C++ developers.
 * Given the learning nature of our work. We would like our work and tools that we use to have
   **flat learning curve**.
 * **Bite-size projects**. The projects should be small enough to finish in 1-2 days, with showable results.
 * **Allowing further exploration**. One thing nice about SFML is that it is both easy-to-learn and 
   not purely pedagogical. It actually uses modern graphics techniques like vertices and shaders. This allows
   further exploration. We like this approach.

## Tools and Resources

 * [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)
 * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
 * [SFML vscode boilerplate](https://github.com/andrew-r-king/sfml-vscode-boilerplate)
 * [Tiled Map Editor](https://www.mapeditor.org/)
 * [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/)
   * Other pixel art / sprite editors: [GraphicsGale](https://graphicsgale.com/us/) (Windows only), 
     [Paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/) (Windows only),
     [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/) (online),
     [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/)
     [Pyxel Edit](https://pyxeledit.com/) tile-based editor
 * [OpenGameArt.org](https://opengameart.org/)

## Code

Our code is at [winterofcode2020](https://github.com/greenpig/winterofcode2020)

 * [scroller](https://github.com/greenpig/winterofcode2020/tree/master/scroller): Code demonstrating tilemap-based drawing 
   and view-based moving.
 * [pong](https://github.com/greenpig/winterofcode2020/tree/master/pong): Basic example from SFML official examples.
